Photo interrupter mount was a little half-hearted.

Skittles are bridging across the bowl hole. Try a increasing the size of the hole or adding a stirring motor.

** Program **
Lots of debug code leftover.

Should make use of the photo interrupter to check position after the cycle has begun to monitor for stepper slip.
